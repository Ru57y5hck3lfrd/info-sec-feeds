# Info-Sec-Feeds

This is a curated list of information security related RSS and atom feeds. 
Feel free to submit your suggestion based on the criteria below.

## Feed Selection

### What I look for in a feed:

High value concise information that aids in establishing an overall view of the
current threat landscape and/or staying to up-to-date with the latest 
vulnerabilites, exploits, tools, and methodologies.

### What I avoid when selecting feeds:

* Marketing and advertisements. 
* Generic advice geared for regular users.

## Installation/Use

I currently use **newsboat** as my RSS reader.
The **urls** file can be directly imported to newsboat by dropping it into 
your **.newsboat/** directory.

If your RSS reader requires an OPML file you can paste the contents of this list
to an OPML generator such as [this one.](https://opml-gen.ovh/)
